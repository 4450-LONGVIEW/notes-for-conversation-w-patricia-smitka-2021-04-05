As noted above, I had come back to town early from a Easter vacation with family early to specically pay the correct amount of lease, in person. 

At or around 9:00 a.m. I heard a truck stop in front of my door, and a rustling of the security door as you were posting the 
"NON-Payment of Rent FINAL NOTICE 5 DAY NOTICE TO PAY OR QUIT" 

Tony:  "Hi Patty, can you give me a minute to get dressed and come out?"

Patty: "Yes"

Tony:  "Patty, what time will you be at Urbana on Hayward so I can come by, and pay rent in person?"

Tony:  "Also, What is the mailing address for Urbana? and what is the correct name for the LLC?"

Patty: "For the lawsuit?"  - not sure what exactly what you meant?

Patty: "It was listed on the Urbana Itroduction letter"

Tony:  "So, I send rent payments to the address on Hayward?"

Patty: "No, I refuse to accept mail at the Hayward address"

Tony:  "Will you write down the correct mailing address?

Patty: "Yes"

Tony:  "Please, also a direct email address for Urbana?"

Small discussion regarding the correct Urbana LLC name, and address. I made no mention, of the formal request that was made Jan 19th, 2021.

Patty: "Please use the online portal to pay rent"


Tony:  "I attempted to pay online, numerous times, the correct amount $459.00 listed in the rental agreement, the payment keeps failing."

Patty: "The rent is $500.68, anything less than that is considered a partial payment, I do not accept partial payments."

Patty: "Anthony, did you read the notice? we are charging for water now as of April 1st, 2020"

Patty: "This is allowed under clause #20 of the rental agreement"

Tony:  "Where is the itemized breakdown of the costs? (for the new water charges)" - as listed under ARS

Tony:  "I would prefer not to pay for watering the lawns"

Patty: "We pay for watering the lawns"

Patty: "We have irrigation for the lawns, those costs are not included"

Patty: "The rent is $500.68, I will not accept anything less" (as you got into your vehicle)

Tony:  "Did you read page ... where it ... bold print....."

You got in your truck, and left the premises. Ending the conversation.
I watched you hurriedly drive away. And went back inside my home. Dumbfounded at what just occurred.


The above notes were made, in good faith, April 9th, 2021.
